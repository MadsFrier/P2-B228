# P2-B228

The RDK file "Robot Work Cell" is the RoboDK simulation. It contains the robot cell and the python script that runs the GUI, the assembly itself, and engraving. The program can be executed by right clicking on the pythong script called "AssemblyProg" in the RoboDK station. If the picture engraving is wished to be tested, a .svg file called "AAU.svg" is included in the repository "P2-B228". Any picture can be engraved, but it would be needed to convert the file to .svg. This can be done in an online converter.

The libraries that is needed for the program to work is pycairo, robolink, and pysimpleGUI.
